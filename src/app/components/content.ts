        sports: `As a mountain biker and skier, I've always been inspired by 
        extreme sports media and content creation. Through taking photos, I have 
        met many great people in the community which has provided me the opportunity
        to get out take photos with amazing athletes.`,

        landscapes: `I started taking photos by capturing landscapes on trips or walks. 
        Living in BC, it is so accessible to simply go outside and find a great place 
        to take photos. I love the feeling of capturing a beautiful view that ends up 
        looking so aesthetically pleasing. Getting the colours and edit the way I like 
        it is a very satisfying process.`,

        automotive: `Similar to my experience with sports photography, I have come to know
        many people in the automotive community through photography. Being interested
        in cars myself, I have always enjoyed meeting up with friends to either take
        photos of their new cars, or showcase any modifications. The variety in cars
        is the best part.`

      videos: {
        mountainbiking: `Mountain biking is my main sport, and through making mountain
        bike content, I love being able to capture the feeling of a day biking in a video.
        Pair clips of riding with a great song and you just get some awesome vibes.`,

        automotive: `Along with automotive photography, creating videos with cars is
        such a great way to showcase how it feels to drive and enjoy them.`,
        
        skiing: `The same said for mountain biking goes with skiing. When I'm not
        mountain biking in the winter, getting out for as many ski trips as I can
        and capturing an awesome day on the mountain is such a great way to
        document the trip.`
