        sports: `I'm all about snapping shots of extreme sports like mountain
        biking and skiing because they get my heart racing just as
        much as the athletes. I'm not just a photographer - I'm out
        there in the action, vibing with fellow adventure junkies.
        What really gets me stoked is catching those epic,
        gravity-defying moments that make these sports a wild ride.
        Flip through my pics to join in on the excitement and
        adrenaline of extreme sports.`,

        landscapes: `Landscape photography is my jam because it gets me out in
        the great outdoors, exploring the beauty of our world.
        Honestly, landscapes just look incredible, and I can't
        resist framing those stunning vistas. Whether it's chasing
        sunsets, hiking through mountains, or simply soaking in the
        serenity of nature, I'm all about capturing these
        breathtaking scenes and sharing their beauty with the world.`,

        automotive: `I'm all about automotive photography because it's a ticket
        to an awesome community of people and some seriously cool
        rides. There's just something about capturing the unique
        character of cars that gets me going. Plus, I love helping
        folks preserve their pride and joy through my lens. So,
        whether it's meeting fellow car enthusiasts, photographing
        rare beauties, or immortalizing the essence of a car, I'm
        revved up and ready to roll.`

        mountainbiking: `I make mountain biking videos Oh yes I do. I make them when
        I ride. It's nice to use a GoPro because I don't even need
        to think about recording, I just do. This is why I like
        making Mountain Biking videos.`,

        automotive: `Car videos! Oooh yes, how I've made a car video. There was a
        car, it was driving, and I was like, oh ya, let's video it. Before we knew it, a car video was born.`,
        
        skiing: `Skiing sometimes. Sometimes take the GoPro with me. Put some music over top, and we got ourselves a skiing video.`
